Calculator

This is a project I started working on while take Computer Science 1.  It is an expression parser / scientific calculator that will evaluate strings input by a user.  It can support up to three variables which can be easily changed.
Since then, I have updated this project to use the built-in Java GUI classes, and fixed any bugs I encountered.
My intention with this project was to build a simple calculator that could be used for course labs, since repeated calculations with just one or two variables changed can be tedious to type into an actual calculator.

Since taking CS3, I have realized that this calculator could be quite a bit better.  For example, converting to postfix notation and using a Stack to evaluate the expression, rather than the recursive-descent-parsing method I found in a book given to me by Prof. Dos Reis, and what I could find online.  But it works just fine, so I have no plans to re-make it.

Simply run calculator.jar to start it up.
