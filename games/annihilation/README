This is a non-code-signed version of this app, prior to uploading to the iOS App Store.
This is the Unity project folder I used when developing this app, with the inclusion of the README and LICENSE files.
The builds directory only includes the latest build, as all builds totalled over 6GB, which is an unneccesary amount to upload.
Also included is the latest .app file (non-code-signed).

This game was uploaded to the iOS App Store and is currently available for download.
