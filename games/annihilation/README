Annihilation is a simple, addicting game in which players try to keep objects from falling off the screen by tapping on them.  Certain types of particles will annihilate one another, freeing up the screen, and scoring more points.  Try to get a high score!

The Assets folder contains all code, images, sound files, etc, used in the Unity project.
The .app folder is a non-code-signed version of this app, before I registered as an Apple iOS developer and uploaded this to the app store

This game was uploaded to the iOS App Store in August 2014 and is currently available for download (for free!).
