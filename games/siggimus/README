Siggimus

Siggimus is a game with lots of shapes flying across the screen.  Players must click on two shapes to make a line between them, and this line will destroy other shapes, scoring points.  When a shape's line has destroyed its limit, the shape turns green and falls.  These green shapes are worth many more points.  The player must meet goals over the course of the game.

This game was developed using Eclipse and Java, and the LWJGL API.  It will not be published, as it was mostly a learning experience, the graphics are crude, and there is no music/sound.
Almost all objects and classes used in this game were developed solely by myself, using many online references.
