PROJECT ABANDONED!!
May remake in 3D, but in 2D it's really not what I was hoping for, so I have moved on to better games for now.

The Mazeling is a game where players must navigate through a maze, collecting the 11 keys scattered in rooms throughout the maze.  There is no large overhead view. Instead, players must remember where they have been as they attempt to find the exit.
Will be released on iOS, and possibly Android (in the future).

Current status:
Phase_0 [graphics/maze build] 
still very incomplete (some maze completed, no graphics)

Phase_1 [movement/basic gameplay] 
design completed, still untested on hardware.

Phase_2 [title scene/save-load mechanics] 
not started

Phase_3 [deeper gameplay/key-lock system] 
not started

Phase_4 [deeper menu/options] 
not started

Phase_5 [music/sfx] 
not started
