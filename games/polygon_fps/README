Polygon FPS (needs an actual title...)

NOTE:
It is unlikely I will finish or continue working on this game anytime soon, as school and other (cooler) physics/astronomy-based projects take up way too much time.
This is the first draft of my development plan for this game.

---
A 3D first-person shooter, using crappy polygonal models I am making.
Currently has no plot or story... really needs one by the time phase 8 is done
---

Side Phase - textures and models (will probably change as plot/theme developed)
some basic weapons completed
no textures yet
no enemy models yet

[DONE] Phase 0.5 - Movement GUI
graphic completed, working on mechanics

[DONE] Phase 1 - Base Gameplay (movement)
accelerometer looking completed (may need sensitivity tweaking)
map_0 for testing completed (may need rendering tweaking due to graphics limitations)
firing projectiles completed (from test project)
movement GUI in progress

Phase 2 - Basic Gameplay (enemies/weapons)
weapon swap completed, no swapping anims (intended for a later build)
enemy class not complete

Phase 3 - Spawners (weapon/enemy)
no weapon spawner objects
no mob spawner objects
no game mechanics that periodically spawn monsters/weapons

Phase 4 - Title and GUI (full onscreen info)
no title screen
no in-game GUI (health bar, points, weapon/ammo display, weapon swap buttons)
player needs HP, points parameters

Phase 5 - Pause Menu
no pause menu
game needs OnGUI pause button (maybe not OnGUI(), could handle in MultiTouchManager)

Phase 6 - Basic Enemy AI
no models, or enemy AI

Phase 7 - Wave Mechanics (gameplay)
player needs wave number parameter
wave mechanics not designed yet (increasing spawn frequency and amount of enemies)

Phase 8 - Death Screen
no death screen yet (display score, give options to replay or return to menu, choose new map, quit, etc)


...many more phases to come, not yet planned out
