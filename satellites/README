Satellite Simulator

TO RUN:
Simply run satellites.jar, either from the command-line, or by double-clicking (if available, such as when running Mac OS).

----------

Satellites is a program that will simulate launching satellites into orbit above the Earth (into low-earth-orbit).  The simulation is rendered in real-time (technically advanced by a large factor), and so is not perfectly accurate.
Each satellite launched can be given a specific mass, initial velocity, and launch angle.  The simulation timescale can also be modified.
While in orbit, a single satellite may be selected and given positive or negative thrust, with the thrust force defined by the user.  The selected satellite can be changed.
Satellites are removed from the simulation when they collide with the Earth, though satellite-satellite collisions are ignored, since they are treated like point-masses.

The scene, while calculated in a 2D, planar orbit, is rendered in 3D and can be rotated and zoomed using keyboard controls.

NOTE:
The source code provided in this directory is not all that is required to compile and run the program.  LWJGL libraries and classes, as well as LWJGL-based classes I have created (such a MyCurve, to render the satellite's path) are not included.  Only the code related to the actual simulation and rendering is found in this directory.
