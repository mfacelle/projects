Orbit Sim

This is still a work-in-progress, as the simulation is not totally accurate.  This is stated below.

TO RUN:
Run the orbitsim/run file in the command line.  This must be done from inside the orbitsim folder! As I have used the ./ directory in the program... still trying to figure out how to reference parent directories easily.
The orbitsim/run script will compile the C++ files, run them, and then it will run orbitsim.jar.

Orbitsim is a program that will simulate a single planet's orbit, accurately in time, around a host star, in C++.  It will then plot the resulting orbit, in Java, using LWJGL.  The two languages communicate via a file called orbitsim.dat.
Yes, it would be faster and more efficient to do all this in just one language (because outputting/inputting a file takes quite a bit of time), but I wanted to try a project in multiple languages that can be run using a single script.

However, this simulation is not totally accurate.  The orbit is plotted, but it seems to move incorrectly at times.  This is probably due to the numerical methods I am using.  I believe it has to do with my starting value for the iterative method; it seems like it doesn't quite converge to the right value.
I will keep working on this, as I am taking Numerical Methods currently.

NOTE:
The Java files provided in java_src/ are not all that is required to run the program.  orbitsim.jar will execute, but it has libraries and other classes that are needed.  My custom LWJGL-based classes as well as the built-in LWJGL classes and libraries are not included in this project folder.
I have only included the relevant Java files related to loading and plotting the data.
