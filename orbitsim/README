Orbit Sim

This is a project that simulates a planetary orbit in time, in C++, and then renders the orbit simulation in Java, using LWJGL.
A data file is used to share location and time data between the languages.

However, the simulation is not currently accurate.  The planet orbit is not rendered in time properly.  This is probably due to the numerical methods I am using (I suspect the starting value for the iterative procedure is the problem).  I will continue working on this project, since I am now taking a Numerical Methods course.

Note: This project folder may not contain all required Java libraries.  I will upload a runnable .jar in the near future, but I must deal with filepath stuff first.
